## Version 0.4

- Mapper select DSL now more closely resembles `Enumerable` syntax
  - Instead of `mapper.select { published_at < Time.now }` you would write `mapper.select { |article| article.published_at < Time.now }`
  - It's a little more typing, but it eliminates a lot of problems that came from calling instance_exec on the block. It meant we couldn't call methods on the current object (they would be invoked on the `Query` object) or use instance variables from the current object.
  - Explained more in [issue #19](https://github.com/jgaskins/perpetuity/issues/19)

## Version 0.3.1

- Access object state via instance methods to store actual object state, rather than treating all objects as value objects
- Use `Object.allocate` rather than `Object.new` when restoring state to an object from the database

## Version 0.3

- Use `Perpetuity[]` instead of `Perpetuity::Mapper[]` to get mapper instances
- Allow subclassing of `Perpetuity::Mapper` with map macro
- Fix `select` calls using `id` as criteria from returning invalid or missing data
- Make MongoDB reads and writes fail fast
- Add indexing API to mappers
- Raise an exception when calling `Perpetuity[]` with a class that has no mapper
- Add unions and intersections to select queries for MongoDB adapter
  - This allows for queries like `Perpetuity[Article].select { (created_at < Time.now) & (published == true) }`
- Update object in memory when calling `Mapper#update`
- Add `Mapper#save` to update an object's current state in the DB. Previously, we only had `#update` (primarily for `update` actions in Rails controllers).
- Silenced some ugly warnings

*Version 0.2 and 0.1 have no changelog because I am a terrible developer*
